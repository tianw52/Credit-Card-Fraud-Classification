# Credit Card Fraud Classification

A supervised learning model which detects credit card fraud. A binary classifier is trained to perform fraud detection analysis on a [credit card transaction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023/data)

## Basic dataset info

The dataset we use is balanced. Each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0)

It has 31 columns, where 29 of them are features (v1-v28 and amount), class is the label.

## Training and testing sets

We use 80% of the data for training and validation, 20% for testing.

## Model
We use a normalization layer to normalize the features first

Then we use a sequentail model with 4 activation layers. The first 3 layers use rectified linear (relu) activation function, output layer use sigmoid (logistic regression) which is commonly used in binary classification (the output is either 1 or 0)
